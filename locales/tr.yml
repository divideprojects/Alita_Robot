      This module allows you to disable some commonly used commands, So, no one can use them. It'll also allow you to autodelete them, stopping people from blue texting.

      *Admin commands*:
      × /disable `<commandname>`: Stop users from using commandname in this group.
      × /enable `<item name>`: Allow users from using commandname in this group.
      × /disableable: List all disableable commands.
      × /disabledel `<yes/no/on/off>`: Delete disabled commands when used by non-admins.
      × /disabled: List the disabled commands in this chat.

      Note:
      When disabling a command, the command only gets disabled for non-admins. All admins can still use those commands.
      Disabled commands are still accessible through the /connect feature. If you would be interested to see this disabled too, let me know in the support chat.

  Filters:
    help_msg: |-
      Filters are case insensitive; every time someone says your trigger words, Alita will reply something else! This can be used to create your commands, if desired.

      Commands:
      - /filter <trigger> <reply>: Every time someone says trigger, the bot will reply with sentence. For multiple word filters, quote the trigger.
      - /filters: List all chat filters.
      - /stop <trigger>: Stop the bot from replying to trigger.
      - /stopall: Stop ALL filters in the current chat. This action cannot be undone.

      Examples:
      - Set a filter:
      -> /filter hello Hello there! How are you?
      - Set a multiword filter:
      -> /filter hello friend Hello back! Long time no see!
      - Set a filter that can only be used by admins:
      -> /filter example This filter won't  happen if a normal user says it {admin}
      - To save a file, image, gif, or any other attachment, simply reply to the file with:
      -> /filter trigger
    errors:  # TODO: Translate - strings.Filters.errors
      limit_exceeded: >-
        Filters limit exceeded, a group can only have maximum 150 filters!\nThis
        limitation is due to bot running free without any donations by users.
      no_keyword: Please give a keyword to reply to!
      invalid_filter: Invalid Filter!
      does_not_exist: Filter does not exist!
    add: # TODO: Translate - strings.Filters.add
      success: Added reply for filter word <code>%s</code>
    remove: # TODO: Translate - strings.Filters.remove
      no_word_specified: Please give a filter word to remove!

  Formatting:
    help_msg: |-
      Alita, iletilerinizi daha ifade edilebilir hale getirmek için çok sayıda biçimlendirme seçeneğini destekler. Aşağıdaki düğmelere tıklayarak bir göz atın!
    Markdown: |-
      <b>Markdown Formatting</b>

      You can format your message using <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <u>underline</u>, and much more. Go ahead and experiment!
      <b>Supported markdown</b>:
      - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows as: <code>code words</code>.
      - <code>_italic words_</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts. Shows as: <i>italic words</i>.
      - <code>*bold words*</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as: <b>bold words</b>.
      - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.
      - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers. Shows as: <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.
      - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting characters inside the text formatted with '```', will be like: <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.
      - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines. Shows as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it as italic. In that case, try to use your app's built-in formatting.
      - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks. Shows as: <a href='https://example.com/'>hyperlink</a>.
      - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button" which opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.

      If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code> formatting.
      <b>Example:</b>
      <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
      <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>
      <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
      This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.
    Fillings: |-
      <b>Fillings</b>

      You can also customise the contents of your message with contextual data. For example, you could mention a user by name in the welcome message, or mention them in a filter!
      You can use these to mention a user in notes too!

      <b>Supported fillings:</b>
      - <code>{first}</code>: The user's first name.
      - <code>{last}</code>: The user's last name.
      - <code>{fullname}</code>: The user's full name.
      - <code>{username}</code>: The user's username. If they don't have one, mentions the user instead.
      - <code>{mention}</code>: Mentions the user with their firstname.
      - <code>{id}</code>: The user's ID.
      - <code>{chatname}</code>: The chat's name.
      - <code>{rules}</code>: Adds Rules Button to Message.
      - <code>{protect}</code>: Protects the content from being shared.
      - <code>{preview}</code>: Enables previews in the messages.
      - <code>{nonotif}</code>: Disables the notification for that message.
    Random: |-
      <b>Random Content</b>

      Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!
      How to use random contents:
      - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.
      For example:
      <code>hello
      %%%
      how are you</code>
      This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the second message, "how are you".
      Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)
      Example welcome message:
      - Every time a new user joins, they'll be presented with one of the three messages shown here.
      -> /filter "hey"
      hello there <code>{first}</code>!
      %%%
      Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?
      %%%
      Sup? <code>{first}</code>

  Reports:

      We're all busy people who don't have time to monitor our groups 24/7. But how do you react if someone in your group is spamming?

      × /report `<reason>`: reply to a message to report it to admins.
