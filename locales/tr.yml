      *Commands*:
      × /connect `<chatid>`: Connect to the specified chat, allowing you to view/edit contents.
      × /disconnect: Disconnect from the current chat.

      × /allowconnect <yes/no>: Allow users to connect to chats or not.

      You can retrieve the chat id by using the /id command in your chat. Don't be surprised if the id is negative; all super groups have negative ids.

  Filters:
    help_msg: |-
      Filters are case insensitive; every time someone says your trigger words, Alita will reply something else! can be used to create your own commands, if desired.

      Commands:
      - /filter <trigger> <reply>: Every time someone says trigger, the bot will reply with sentence. For multiple word filters, quote the trigger.
      - /filters: List all chat filters.
      - /stop <trigger>: Stop the bot from replying to trigger.
      - /stopall: Stop ALL filters in the current chat. This cannot be undone.

      Examples:
      - Set a filter:
      -> /filter hello Hello there! How are you?
      - Set a multiword filter:
      -> /filter hello friend Hello back! Long time no see!
      - Set a filter that can only be used by admins:
      -> /filter example This filter wont happen if a normal user says it {admin}
      - To save a file, image, gif, or any other attachment, simply reply to file with:
      -> /filter trigger
  Formatting:
    help_msg: |-
      Alita, iletilerinizi daha ifade edilebilir hale getirmek için çok sayıda biçimlendirme seçeneğini destekler. Aşağıdaki düğmelere tıklayarak bir göz atın!
    Markdown: |-
      <b>Markdown Formatting</b>

      You can format your message using <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <u>underline</u>, and much more. Go ahead and experiment!
      <b>Supported markdown</b>:
      - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows as: <code>code words</code>.
      - <code>_italic words_</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts. Shows as: <i>italic words</i>.
      - <code>*bold words*</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as: <b>bold words</b>.
      - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.
      - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers. Shows as: <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.
      - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting characters inside the text formatted with '```', will be like: <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.
      - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines. Shows as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it as italic. In that case, try to use your app's built-in formatting.
      - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks. Shows as: <a href='https://example.com/'>hyperlink</a>.
      - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button" which opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.

      If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code> formatting.
      <b>Example:</b>
      <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
      <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>
      <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
      This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.
    Fillings: |-
      <b>Fillings</b>

      You can also customise the contents of your message with contextual data. For example, you could mention a user by name in the welcome message, or mention them in a filter!
      You can use these to mention a user in notes too!

      <b>Supported fillings:</b>
      - <code>{first}</code>: The user's first name.
      - <code>{last}</code>: The user's last name.
      - <code>{fullname}</code>: The user's full name.
      - <code>{username}</code>: The user's username. If they don't have one, mentions the user instead.
      - <code>{mention}</code>: Mentions the user with their firstname.
      - <code>{id}</code>: The user's ID.
      - <code>{chatname}</code>: The chat's name.
      - <code>{rules}</code>: Adds Rules Button to Message.
    Random: |-
      <b>Random Content</b>

      Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!
      How to use random contents:
      - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.
      For example:
      <code>hello
      %%%
      how are you</code>
      This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the second message, "how are you".
      Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)
      Example welcome message:
      - Every time a new user joins, they'll be presented with one of the three messages shown here.
      -> /filter "hey"
      hello there <code>{first}</code>!
      %%%
      Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?
      %%%
      Sup? <code>{first}</code>

      Bağış mı yapmak istiyorsun? İnanılmaz!
      Bağışta bulunduğunda tüm fon benim gelişime doğru gidiyor. Bu da hızlı ve duyarlı hale getiriyor.
      Bağışınız bana yeni bir ya da iki özellik getirmemi de sağlar, ki bu da sunucu kısıtlamalarından dolayı alamadığım bir şey.
      tüm fon, veritabanı, depolama ve hosting gibi hizmetlerime konacaktır!
