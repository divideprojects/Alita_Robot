  Formatting:
    help_msg: Alita supports a large number of formatting options to make your messages
      more expressive. Take a look by clicking the buttons below!
    Markdown: '<b>Markdown Formatting</b>


      You can format your message using <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <u>underline</u>,
      and much more. Go ahead and experiment!

      <b>Supported markdown</b>:

      - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows as:
      <code>code words</code>.

      - <code>_italic words_</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts. Shows
      as: <i>italic words</i>.

      - <code>*bold words*</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as: <b>bold
      words</b>.

      - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as:
      <strike>strikethrough</strike>.

      - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers. Shows
      as: <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.

      - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting characters
      inside the text formatted with ''```'', will be like: <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.

      - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines. Shows
      as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it as italic.
      In that case, try to use your app''s built-in formatting.

      - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks.
      Shows as: <a href=''https://example.com/''>hyperlink</a>.

      - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting
      used for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button"
      which opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.


      If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code>
      formatting.

      <b>Example:</b>

      <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

      <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>

      <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>

      This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.'
    Fillings: '<b>Fillings</b>


      You can also customise the contents of your message with contextual data. For
      example, you could mention a user by name in the welcome message, or mention
      them in a filter!

      You can use these to mention a user in notes too!


      <b>Supported fillings:</b>

      - <code>{first}</code>: The user''s first name.

      - <code>{last}</code>: The user''s last name.

      - <code>{fullname}</code>: The user''s full name.

      - <code>{username}</code>: The user''s username. If they don''t have one, mentions
      the user instead.

      - <code>{mention}</code>: Mentions the user with their firstname.

      - <code>{id}</code>: The user''s ID.

      - <code>{chatname}</code>: The chat''s name.

      - <code>{rules}</code>: Adds Rules Button to Message.

      - <code>{protect}</code>: Protects the content from being shared.

      - <code>{preview}</code>: Enables previews in the messages.

      - <code>{nonotif}</code>: Disables the notification for that message.'
    Random: '<b>Random Content</b>


      Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make
      things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!

      How to use random contents:

      - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.

      For example:

      <code>hello

      %%%

      how are you</code>

      This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the
      second message, "how are you".

      Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)

      Example welcome message:

      - Every time a new user joins, they''ll be presented with one of the three messages
      shown here.

      -> /filter "hey"

      hello there <code>{first}</code>!

      %%%

      Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?

      %%%

      Sup? <code>{first}</code>'
