Alita is a Telegram Group management bot made using **[Gotgbot](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/gotgbot)** and **[Go](https://go.dev)**, which makes it modern and faster than most of the existing Telegram Chat Managers.

**Alita's features over other bots:**
- Modern
- Fast
- Fully open-source
- Frequently updated
- Multi Language Support

Can be found on Telegram as [@Alita_Robot](https://t.me/Alita_Robot)
</br>

Alita is currently available in one Language as of now:
- **US English**

More languages can be managed in the _locales_ folder. Although we have added support for languages in bot, we still need contributors to translate the bot to other languages.

More languages have been added to the locales folder but need some configuration.

Help us bring more languages to the bot by contributing to the project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/alitarobot)

## Requirements
- You need to have a *Mongo Database* (Cluster Preferred)
- You also need a *Redis Database* for caching (Required): Get a free redis database from [here](https://redis.com/try-free/)
- Linux/Windows machine (Ubuntu/Debain-based OS Preferred or Windows 10/Server2016 and later)

or
- Docker (Easiest way to set up the bot)

## How to setup

First Step!
- Star **⭐** the repository!!
- Fork **🔱** the repository before deploying and making changes in the fork.

It really motivates me to continue this project further.

### Deploy to Heroku:
- Get your Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

**Note:** As it is banned for an unknown reason in heroku, follow the below steps carefully!
- First Fork this repo `:)`
- secondly, create an empty app in the Heroku, with a custom app name; and select Europe region for faster speed.
- Now go to the deploy tab of your app and under deployment method, select GitHub and connect it.
- after that, type the forked repo name and select it now select the main branch and enable auto deploy, at last click on deploy now button!

- Lastly, you must fill up all the vars in heroku (if using heroku) as directed in app.json file and now turn on the worker dyno to run it `:)`

**Must Add in heroku [config](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/yourappname/settings) :**
- `DB_URI` : Get one from [mongodb](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
- `OWNER_ID` : your telegram id
- `MESSAGE_DUMP` : must be start with `-100` or your bot added in as **admin**

### Deploy to VPS:
#### 1. Install Go
Follow the instructions to install Go on your system: [Go Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)

#### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divideprojects/Alita_Robot.git
cd Alita_Robot
```

#### 3. Set up the environment
Copy the sample environment file and edit it as needed:
```shell
cp sample.env .env
vi .env
```

#### 4. Build and run the bot
```bash
go build -o alita_robot main.go
./alita_robot
```


### Traditional

- Download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/divideprojects/Alita_Robot/releases) page specific to your PC.
- Set the required env variables and run the binary

**Note:** Not a lot of people may be able to run using this because the instructions aren't clear but I'll try to make it clear in future.

### Docker

We currently publish a `ghcr.io/divideprojects/alita_robot` Docker image based on alpine.

Set the Environmental vars using the `-e` flag in while running the container.

If all works well, bot should send a message to the **MESSAGE_DUMP** Group!

### Other

You can download all binaries and release artifacts from the Releases page. Binaries are built for macOS, Linux, Windows, for amd64 and arm64 architectures.

If a binary does not yet exist for the OS/architecture you use, please open a GitHub Issue.


## Verify Signature

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of any released artifact using a public GPG key. All release artifacts are signed and have a corresponding signature file. Release artifacts are available on the Releases page.

# fetch GPG signing key
```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 9CAFFF2AC5F94C7C
```
# example: verify a release package
```bash
gpg --verify alita_robot_2.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz.sig alita_robot_2.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz || echo "Verification failed!"
```
